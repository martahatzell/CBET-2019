\section{Overview \& Motivation} 
\vspace{1mm}


The main research objective of this proposal is to understand how photocatalytic earth-abundant nanominerals in soils and sands contribute to reactive nitrogen (NH\textsubscript{3}  and N\textsubscript{2}O) emissions into the atmosphere. Atmospheric \NH\hspace{.5mm} and \NO\hspace{.5mm} are well known environmental pollutants which are increasing largely due to anthropogenic activities associated with the agriculture (Fig \ref{fig:N2cycle} - top). These gases are emitted at a slower rate than CO\textsubscript{2}; however, are significantly more harmful to the environment.  For instance, \NO\hspace{.5mm} has a global warming potential of 298 and \NH\hspace{.5mm} allows for the formation of fine \begin{wrapfigure}{r}{0.33\textwidth}

\vspace{-2mm}
\end{wrapfigure}aerosol nitrates (NH\textsubscript{4}NO\textsubscript{3}) 
which contribute to increased atmospheric particulate matter (PM) which is hazardous to human health\cite{makar_2009}. This increase in nitrogen based emissions results in an imbalance in the nitrogen cycle, and is one reason why the National Academy of Engineering has listed, ``Managing the nitrogen cycle'' as one of the Grand Challenges of the next century. 


%The nitrogen cycle is almost exclusively centered around microbial nitrogen-based transformation. While microorganisims play a large role in mediating the nitrogen cycle, numerous lab demonstrations show that nearly every biotic reaction is possible through photochemical abiotic-based transformation on mineral catalyst. Notably, photochemical nitrification\cite{DHAR_1932,DHAR_1933,DHAR_1934,mclean1965reactions,kebede2013photooxidation}, nitrogen fixation \cite{dhar1941new,DHAR_1944,Schrauzer1977}, and denitrification \cite{cunningham1971reactions,blyholder1971photocatalytic} are noted to occur in natural settings under ambient conditions (see Fig. \ref{fig:N2cycle})a \cite{doane2017abiotic}. This raises the key question regarding if these lab-demonstrated reactions can occur in the environment.  The \textbf{central hypothesis of the proposed work is that earth abundant oxides in concert with sulfides do aid in mediating the abiotic nitrogen cycle}. 



%The nitrogen cycle is critical for life, as all living organisms need nitrogen to build amino acids, protein and tissue. It is also well recognized that human civilization is reliant on our ability to manage the nitrogen cycle in a way that allows for the production of enough nutrients to feed our growing population\cite{Galloway_2004}. This was even acknowledged by the National Academy of Engineering, which recently stated that managing the nitrogen cycle will be one of the Grand Challenges of the next century. However, in order to begin to manage the nitrogen cycle, we must fully understand all relevant transformations. Measuring and tracking these transformations has been a challenge, as the biogeochemical nutrient cycle includes nine possible intermediates, with oxidation states ranging from -3 to +5. For this reason, the nitrogen cycle is often deemed the ``most advanced biogeochemical cycle''\cite{stein2016nitrogen}. While significant progress has been made in describing the nitrogen cycle, nearly all terrestrial nitrogen transformations are still solely attributed to five biotic processes (nitrification, denitrification, fixation, ammonification, and anammox)\cite{Howard_1996}. 

Most agricultural related nitrogen emissions are largely thought to be due solely to microbial activities such as nitrogen fixation (\NH) and denitrification (\NO), and fertilizer volatilization. However, numerous abiotic solar-driven nitrogen transformation have been shown to be catalytic possible using earth-abundant photocatalytic nanominerals\cite{doane2017abiotic}. Photocatalytic nanominerals are widely abundant in soils and sand and exist primarily as oxides. The various minerals differ in the compositions and type of metals (Fe,Ti,Zn,W,Sr) contained within the crystal lattice which contribute to minerals with different band gaps and band edge (conduction and valance) locations (Fig \ref{fig:N2cycle}-bottom). Only a handful of research studies have been conducted to evaluate the activity of photocatalytic nanominerals, the preliminary evidence suggests that they are active for various nitrogen based transformation. For instance,  photonitrification\cite{DHAR_1932,DHAR_1933,DHAR_1934,mclean1965reactions,kebede2013photooxidation}, photofixation (nitrogen fixation) \cite{dhar1941new,DHAR_1944,Schrauzer1977}, and photodenitrification \cite{cunningham1971reactions,blyholder1971photocatalytic} have been confirmed to take place in natural settings under ambient conditions\cite{doane2017abiotic}. \textbf{There however have been no studies to investigate equilibrium partitioning of these photochemically derived intermediates and products between soils and air}. This has global importance, as documenting all emissions sources is necessary in order to develop robust climate models, and engineer solutions to mitigate the imbalance in the nitrogen cycle. Therefore, we aim to explore how these reactions contribute to atmsopheric emissions through the following research questions and hypotheses:

\section{Technical Background}
\vspace{1mm}
\vspace{1mm}
\subsubsection*{Nitrogen Photochemistry and the Lithosphere} 
\vspace{1mm}

Photochemical nitrogen transformation were initially pioneered by a prominent Indian soil scientist, N.R. Dhar, in the 1930-40s \cite{DHAR_1932}. Dhar and colleagues' early work focused on illuminating sterile soils (no bacteria) with known ammonia salts. These early works, while far from conclusive, hinted that the rate of abiotic ammonia oxidation (nitrification) increased in the presence of sunlight.These results remained unverified until 1977, when Schrauzer and Guth also began to investigate this process on natural minerals\cite{Schrauzer1977,schrauzer1979nitrogen}. They restricted their focuses to Fe-doped titania and desert sands. Initially they collected common rocks, clays and sands. Results from controlled photocatalyic testing performed under sun-light indicated that \emph{common rocks did not exhibit high activity} for photofixation of nitrogen, but that \emph{sands were active}. Despite these initial findings, modern experimental and theoretical techniques have yet to be applied to the abiotic soil-nitrogen cycle, and no studies have looked at any additional photocatalytic processes beyond nitrogen fixation. However, these early works did try to quantify to potential impact of this point-source, and estimated that as much as \textcolor{red}{X\%} of all fixed nitrogen could come from photocatalyzed reactions. Despite this interesting finding, phtocatalyzed production of \NH\hspace{1mm} and \NO\hspace{1mm} are not included in any environmental emissions inventories. 





\vspace{1mm}
\subsubsection*{Nitrogen Photochemistry and the Atmospheric}
\vspace{1mm}

Nitrogen-based photochemical transformations in atmospheric sciences has been largely  restricted to understanding the fate of emitted pollutants (\NH, \NO, NO\textsubscript{x})\cite{hahn_1982}. With most emphasis on characterizing \NO\hspace{2mm}and NO\textsubscript{x}, and less emphasis on \NH. \NO\hspace{2mm}and NO\textsubscript{x} act as photochemical catalyst that drive numerous reaction\cite{hahn_1982,spicer_1977}, which result in the production of soluble nitrogen species (nitric acid and nitrate). These soluable species are important in order to predict atmospheric distribution of ozone, and the likelihood for acid rain and smog\cite{zheng_2005}. More recently, a growing concern over increased ammonia emissions (especially from agriculture related livestock), has sparked interest in characterizing photocatalytic derived nitrate (NH\textsubscript{4}NO\textsubscript{3}\textsubscript{(s)}) and sulfate ((NH\textsubscript{4})\textsubscript{2}SO\textsubscript{4}\textsubscript{(s)}) aerosols. A recent study showed that the the concentrated nature of ammonia emissions from livestock farms (compared to a more disperse emission from automobiles), results in increased levels of aerosol formation\cite{nowak_2012}. These observations, are not currently captured in atmospheric models, but show that the fate of nitrogen-based emissions is dependent on the point source (e.g. automobile versus livestock). Advances in atmospheric chemical transport models are needed to predict air quality with precision. In order to do this, expanded emissions inventories capable of factoring all point sources (including photocatalytic minerals in sands and soils) are needed. 

\subsubsection*{Emissions Inventories for \NH\hspace{.5mm} and \NO} 
\vspace{1mm}

Significant evidence suggests that the global nitrogen cycle is not balanced. However, a chief challenge in understanding this imbalance, lies in quantifying and identifying all nitrogen pools and fluxes in the atmosphere and lithosphere\cite{reis_2009}. This requires high resolution measurements of both natural and anthropogenic sources and sinks. These measurements are compiled in emissions inventories which are then used to validate models. Thus developing robust inventories is critical in order to fully validate nitrogen cycle models\cite{anderson_2003}. In the United States, the National Emissions Inventory (NEI) is maintained by the EPA in support of the Clean Air Act. Contrary to what one may think, anthropogenic sources are generally more accurately mapped than emissions from natural or semi-natural sources\cite{reis_2009}. Therefore, further efforts to define missing natural sources is am important step in advancing our understanding of the nitrogen cycle.

\section{Research Plan}
\label{sec:research_plan}
\vspace{1mm}


\subsection{Research Approach: Synthesis \& Characterization, Atmospheric Measurements, and Theory}
\label{sec:methods_approach}

\vspace{1mm}
\subsubsection*{Global Approach:}
\vspace{1mm}

The research plan is divided into three main thrusts, each of which encompasses experiments and theory. With the primary aim of this proposal to discern the role photochemically active mineral in the lithosphere contribute to atmospheric \NH\hspace{1mm} and \NO, the first thrust will focus on synthesis and characterization of minerals with controlled properties (size, facet, shape, phase). The second thrust will explore the role lithospheric properties (soil moisture content, soil pH, N concentration) play in promoting \NH\hspace{1mm} and \NO. The third thrust then explore the role atmospheric properties (solar intensity, CO\textsubscript{2} concentration, temperature) play in promoting \NH\hspace{1mm} and \NO. Below we briefly discuss our overall experimental and computational research approach. 

\vspace{1mm}
\subsubsection*{Materials Synthesis and Characterization:}
\vspace{1mm}
Mineral-based photocatalytic materials (oxides) will be prepared in the lab through controlled standard sol-gel and hydrothermal methods\cite{zhu2012hydrothermal}. Post processing of the particles and films through various synthesis methods (thermal, solid-state, microwave) can provide uniform minerals with various polymorphs (phase), particle size, and surface structure (facets)\cite{yu2003effect, macwan2011review,music1997chemical}. Photocatalytic testing will be conducted using a flow-cell reactor which was designed by the Hatzell lab. The system is capable of controlling various reactant concentration (N\textsubscript{2}, O\textsubscript{2}, H\textsubscript{2}O, Ar, Air), temperature and solar irradiation (Xenon arc lamp source). Gas-phase products can be measured using a gas chromatography (CO\textsubscript{2}, H\textsubscript{2}, O\textsubscript{2}, N\textsubscript{2}) and mass spectrometer (NO\textsubscript{x}). Gas-phase ammonia is measured by converting ammonia to ammonium ions, and measuring the ammonium concentration via standard EPA based methods (UV-vis)\cite{o1993epa}. Nitrate and nitrite can also be measured using standard EPA based methods\cite{doane2003spectrophotometric}. Finally, electrocatalytic testings (rotating ring disk electrode experiments) with and without illumination will provide insight into the redox properties and activity of the minerals for various nitrogen-based reactions. 

%Hydrothermal processing will create controlled particles using a high temperature (200\degree C) and pressure vessel (autoclave). The applied temperature and synthesis time dictate the particle size and uniformity. All synthesized materials will be characterized using XRD (crystallinity), SEM and SEM-EDS (particle size and morphology), ICP (metal composition) and XPS (surface chemistry). Uniform colloid mixtures will be characterized by dynamic light scattering to discern the polydispersity of particles. All techniques are available to the experimental PI (Hatzell) through their labs or Georgia Tech user facilities.

\vspace{1mm}
\subsubsection*{Atmospheric Measurements}
\vspace{1mm}


\vspace{1mm}
\subsubsection*{Computational}
\vspace{1mm}

The computational approach will rely primarily on density functional theory (DFT), statistical mechanics, and the computational hydrogen electrode (CHE) model. Ground-state energies of surfaces, adsorbates, and gas molecules will be computed using DFT as implemented in the Quantum ESPRESSO software package \cite{ESPRESSO}. Gibbs free energies will be computed using the harmonic oscillator partition function in conjunction with computed vibrational frequencies as implemented in the ASE software package \cite{ASE}. The CHE formalism \cite{Norskov_2004} will be used to account for the redox potential of conduction/valence band electrons; this approach has proven successful for treating photochemical water splitting \cite{Hellman_2017}. Initially solvent effects and dipole effects will be neglected in order to more rapidly identify surfaces and mechanistic pathways that are most favorable; this will be followed by more detailed studies including explicit solvent layers and applied fields to assess the importance of these additional effects. We note that the goal of the computational approaches in this work is to establish \highlight{thermodynamics} of the interaction between mineral surfaces and nitrogen species under photochemical conditions. The treatment of kinetic photochemical processes (e.g. charge transfer dynamics) is beyond the scope of this work; however we note that thermodynamic information provides considerable insight by establishing limiting cases, and has proven useful in understanding a range of (photo)electrochemical reactions \cite{Norskov_2004,Peterson_2010,skulason2012theoretical,Comer_2017,Hellman_2017}.

%Although titania and hematite have been extensively studied with computational methods \cite{Diebold2003,Schaub_2001,Li_2008,Morgan_2007,Zheng_2016,Jauho_2015,Landmann_2012,De_k_2011,Lopes_2016,Souvi_2013,Rollmann_2004,Rohrbach_2004} there is no consensus regarding the level of theory needed. Some work indicates that catalytic properties, even of defects, can be understood at the GGA level of theory \cite{Schaub_2001,Li_2008,Zheng_2016}, while other studies have shown that a proper description of all electronic and optical properties require treatment with DFT+U or hybrid functionals \cite{Morgan_2007,Landmann_2012,De_k_2011,Rohrbach_2004}. Furthermore, double-hybrid methods such as GW, BSE\cite{Landmann_2012}, and RPA with renormalized kernels \cite{Jauho_2015} provide the most accurate description of optical properties and formation energies. For this project a hierarchy of approaches will be utilized, with the initial calculations performed with the BEEF-vdW functional \cite{Wellendorff2012}. This GGA functional has the advantage that it provides a quantitative estimate of the error due to the XC approximation. This uncertainty quantification feature will be exploited to determine the probability of a hypothesis being true, given the uncertainty in the XC approximation; Medford is an expert in uncertainty propagation/analysis with DFT calculations \cite{Medford2014a,Yang_2016,Ulissi_2017,Comer_2017}. This approach will enable testing a much broader range of hypotheses and rapidly identifying those with the highest probability of being true. The energies of the most critical systems will be refined using a hierarchy of higher-level methods such as DFT+U, hybrid functionals (HSE), and GW/RPA. These higher-level methods will also provide more accurate estimates of excited-state properties that may ultimately be relevant for photochemical nitrogen transformations.

\label{sec:SA1}

\subsubsection*{Introduction \& Preliminary Results}
\vspace{1mm}

\begin{wrapfigure}{r}{0.45\textwidth}

\vspace{-1mm}
\fbox{\includegraphics[width=0.45\textwidth]{scripts/figures/Materials}}
\caption{(a)Metal-doped Titania synthesized by sol-gel processing. (b and c) Material properties (crystallinty) and surface structure obtained from XRD and XPS.}
\label{fig:material}
\vspace{-2mm}
\end{wrapfigure}Oxide based materials have been heavily investigated as photocatalyst for both solar fuel production (hydrogen) as well as for water treatment\cite{tran_2012,lee_2016,nakata_2012}. The most abundantly studied oxide is titanium dioxide (\TIO). \TIO\hspace{2mm} is a wide band gap (3.2 eV), and therefore only absorbs UV light.  The PI has extensively synthesized and characterization \TIO\hspace{1mm} and metal doped \TIO\hspace{1mm} for photocatalytic nitrogen fixation (Fig. \ref{fig:material} and Fig. \ref{fig:experiments}). Characterizating the crystal structure and surface properties is accomplished through standard x-ray based and photo(electro)chemical characterization methods available to the PI at Georgia Tech (See Facilities). XRD provides insight into the crystal polymorphs (Fig. \ref{fig:material}b) and XPS provides quantative insight into the degree of defects (vacanies) at the surface (Fig. \ref{fig:material}c). In addition, rotating ring disk electrode experiments (Fig. \ref{fig:material}d) provides insight into the redox-based catalytic behavior of the minerals. 

Thus, the goal of this thrust is to synthesize nanoparticle-based oxides with controlled compositions. This includes oxides with various phases (anatase, rutile, brookite), size, and with different facets. Catalytic activity of oxides is well known to be dependent on the concentration of active sites, and all thus by tuning the various material properties we aim to identify what properties promote activity for various reactions (e.g. nitrogen fixation, denitrification, nitrification).  Considering the diverse nature of soils and sands, we also aim to epxlore additional oxides such as, iron oxides (FeTiO$_3$, Fe$_2$O$_3$, FeOOH), zinc oxide (ZnO$_2$), Tungsten trioxide (WO$_3$), and strontium titanate (SrTiO$_3$). These oxides were chosen based on their abundance in soils and sands (iron oxides) and their catalytic properties (ZnO$_2$,SrTiO$_3$,WO$_3$). Each mineral differs in terms of their electronic properties (bandgap and band edge locations), crystal structure and phase (anatase, rutile, brookite), crystal size, surface structuring (edge facets). In thrust I the PI will synthesize and characterize (experimentally and theoretically) the catalytic and electronic properties of these material prior their testing in thrust II and III.

\subsubsection{Synthesize oxide a nanominerals with controlled phase, facets and size}
\label{sec:SA1_1}
\vspace{1mm}

There have been no systematic investigations of the activity of mineral crystallinity on photocatalytic generation of \NO\hspace{1mm} and \NH. In addition, little work has been completed to evaluate the effect of particle size and shape (controlled facet). While large particles result in smaller effective surface area, these particles may have a higher concentration of bulk or surface defects which could promote various N-based transformations. In addition, surface structuring is critical to promote various intermediate processes (e.g. N-N and N-O activation), yet it is unknown what facets promote small nitrogen-based molecule activation. This objective seeks to conclusively define the active mineral phase and facet by evaluating the  turnover frequencies and quantum efficiencies.

The goal will be achieved by testing commercial oxides (e.g. Degussa P25), single crystals (e.g.TiO$_{2}$ (100), (101), Fe$_2$O$_3$ (0001), SrTiO$_3$ (100), SrTiO$_3$ (110), SrTiO$_3$ (111), ZnO (0001)), synthesized nanoparticles, and thin films under various reaction conditions. The synthesized oxide \begin{wrapfigure}{l}{0.5\textwidth}

\caption{Well-defined nanoparticles will provide a route to control the relative concentration of various surface terminations for oxide based photocatalyst. Upper panels illustrate potential nanoparticle shapes while lower panels show low-energy surface terminations.}\label{fig:TiO2_facets}
\vspace{-14pt}
\end{wrapfigure}nanoparticles will have be be prepared primarily through wet chemical routes. Iron oxides can be synthesized through co-precipitating Fe$^{2+}$ and Fe$^{3+}$ aqueous salt solutions by the addition of base. Through varying the electrolyte chemistry (salts, pH, and ionic strength), the size, shape and composition of the nanoparticles can be tuned\cite{gupta_2005}. Titania and ZnO$_2$ will be prepared through standard sol-gel processing, and the material composition will be tuned through post processing methods (hydrothermal and thermal processing)\cite{chen_2009}. Again tuning the solution ionic strength and pH allows for the production of uniform size particles. SrTiO$_3$ will be made through a solid-state reaction conducted under microwave heating. Post-synthesis ball-milling will be required to attain particles at the nanoscale\cite{makarova_2010}. Finally, particles with controlled surface facets (TiO$_2$ and ZnO$_2$) will be generated through the use of capping or
surfactant based approaches during hydrothermal synthesis \cite{Dinh2009,Liao2007} (Figure \ref{fig:TiO2_facets}). Surfactants serve to limit the particle size, while capping approaches will be utilized to tune the growth direction. Amorphous nanoparticles of  can be synthesized using common sol-gel  \cite{ReyesCoronado2008}.  The vast array of commercial, single crystal and synthesized particles will enable us to decouple the role electronic and surface properties play in the evolution of \NH\hspace{1mm} and \NO\hspace{1mm} in thrust II and III. 



\vspace{1mm}
\subsubsection{Ex-situ Mineral Characterization}
\vspace{1mm}
Particles will be thoroughly characterized with microscopy (SEM/TEM) and
dynamic light scattering (DLS) to confirm the morphology, structure,
size uniformity and facets. Diffraction (XRD) approaches will be
utilized to confirm the phase and purity, and \NN{} physisorption be conducted on
nanoparticles to confirm the surface area. The thermal behavior, surface structure and surface chemistry of all synthesized catalyst will be characterized by differential thermal analysis (DTA), XRD and XPS. The presence of the Fe dopant should be visible through the thermic effects (curve shifting) and weight loss observed through the DTA analysis, as well as through inductively coupled plasma mass spectroscopy (ICP-MS) \cite{Huang_2001}.  In addition, the O1s, Ti2p, and Fe2p binding energies will be recorded using XPS to measure the oxidation states of Ti and Fe based surface species. Finally, UV/Vis spectroscopy
will be utilized to characterize the absorption and optical bandgap
changes that result due to from various synthesis approaches.



\vspace{1mm}
\subsubsection{Use ab-initio thermodynamics to compute surface coverages}
\vspace{1mm}
The preliminary results shown in Fig. \ref{fig:phase_diagrams} illustrate how DFT calculations can provide insight into the role of the environment on catalytic activity. This type of ab initio thermodynamic analysis will be extended to include the most promising materials and surface facets identified in Sec. \ref{sec:SA1}. The analysis will be extended to include a more diverse range of intermediates, including the oxidized/reduced nitrogen intermediates that form the reaction network for nitrogen fixation and nitrification. Furthermore, the analysis will be extended to include additional chemical potential variables, ultimately seeking to map out the most abundant surface species as a function of oxygen (O$_2$), hydrogen (H$_2$O), nitrogen (N$_2$) and carbon (CO$_2$). This high-dimensional map can be projected onto an arbitrary reaction condition so that the surface state can be analyzed in terms of temperature and gas ratios; Medford has demonstrated this technique in prior work on carbide and oxide surfaces under\begin{wrapfigure}{r}{0.5\textwidth}

\vspace{1mm}
\subsubsection{Calculate interaction between different facets and probe molecules}
\vspace{1mm}The use of DFT provides significant insight into the energetics of binding of intermediates and various materials surfaces, as shown in Fig. \ref{fig:DFT_fixation_energies}. However, probing the full reaction network for nitrogen fixation and nitrification on the various surface facets of rutile, anatase, and hematite would be prohibitively expensive. In order to address this challenge we will select model surfaces for each material. These surfaces will be chosen based on stability (e.g. low-index facets such as rutile (110)) and hypothesized activity (e.g. oxygen vacancies and edge defects). We will select 3 representative surfaces for each material, as well as 6 surfaces that include both Ti and Fe to assess the effects of doping and chemical mixtures (e.g. Fe-substitution on rutile, Ti substitution on hematite), leading to a total of 15 model surfaces. In order to quickly screen these surfaces for nitrogen transformation activity we will utilize four probe molecules: N$_2$*, N*, NH*, and NO*. he binding energies of these probe molecules will provide insight into the reactivity of various 
surfaces toward dinitrogen as well as oxidized/reduced nitrogen species. The findings will be used, along with insight gained from experimental investigations, to identify the most reactive surfaces and to suggest other surfaces not in the original test set that might be more relevant. This iterative process will lead to computational models of the active site/surface on rutile, anatase, hematite, and mixtures of titania and hematite.
\vspace{1mm}

\subsubsection{Calculate free energy diagrams}
\label{sec:SA3_3}
\vspace{1mm}

The energetics of all relevant reaction intermediates for nitrogen fixation and nitrification will be computed for the surfaces with the most promising energetics (Sec. \ref{sec:SA1}) and the highest relative reactivity toward nitrogen species under relevant conditions (Sec. \ref{sec:SA2}). These energies will be used to generate free energy diagrams, similar to Figs. \ref{fig:DFT_fixation_energies} and \ref{fig:FEDs}. The CHE model will be used to assess the feasibility of reaction pathways under illumination, similar to Fig. \ref{fig:FEDs}b. Uncertainty quantification via the BEEF-vdW functional will provide estimates of the error due to the XC approximation, as illustrated in Fig. \ref{fig:FEDs}. This error estimate will allow efficient identification of the mechanisms that are most probable, while dismissing mechanisms that are thermodynamically infeasible. As the most likely mechanisms and active sites are identified they will be refined by inclusion of explicit solvent layers and use of higher-order theoretical methods such as DFT+U and HSE06. These calculations, coupled with the experimental characterizations, will result in a molecular-scale understanding of the active site and reaction mechanism of photon-driven nitrogen fixation and nitrification on anatase, rutile, and hematite surfaces.

Establishing a benchmark system for photoelectrochemical testing will be
of particular importance since these experiments have not been
previously reported. Various conductive supports (graphite, FTO, ITO, etc.)
will be utilized during testing depending on how the films will be
characterized and tested (spectroscopy, photoelectrochemical,
microscopy). Films will be tested, and the influence of particle size. Electrochemical impedance
spectroscopy (EIS) will be performed on thin films to measure the charge
transfer resistance of the photoelectrodes and catalysts. Catalytic
activity of the samples will be probed through varying the applied bias
with a potentiostat using a three electrode electrochemical cell, and quantum efficiencies will be obtained by
varying the photon energy through in situ UV/Vis spectroscopy.
Measured activity will be correlated with the relative abundance of
exposed facets to provide insight into which facets are
responsible for selective photo-catalytic nitrogen fixation\cite{Cargnello_2016}.

\end{wrapfigure}Catalytic studies of nanoparticles and thin films with well-defined ratios of active facets have proven successful in elucidation and engineering of the active surfaces of titania for photocatalytic methanol decomposition \cite{Bennett_2016,Cargnello_2016}, and a similar strategy is expected to apply to nitrogen photofixation, photonitrification, and photodenitrification.  Initial experiments by the Hatzell lab have successfully reproduced early work completed by Shrauzer and Guth which focuses on understanding photofixation of nitrogen\cite{Schrauzer1977}. Titania catalysts synthesized using sol gel synthesis resulted in materials with optically visible differences (Fig. \ref{fig:material}a), which resulted in differences in the rate of photofixation of nitrogen with metal dopants (Fig. \ref{fig:experiments}a) and with organic matter present (Fig. \ref{fig:experiments}b). Overall, the results conclusively showed that ammonia is produced during photofixation on titania based minerals, and that the rate at which ammonia is produced increases in the presence of iron dopant. The role of the iron dopant has not yet been discerned, as it could aid in trapping electrons, activating nitrogen or may promote various defects (oxygen vacancies). Despite this, the initial experiments support the findings that photofixation of nitrogen is possible on titania and iron-doped titania. 




%The nitrogen fixation, nitrification and denitification activity of these nanoparticles and thin films will be tested for photocatalytic activity under humidified or dry gas. The performance will be benchmarked with isotopically labeled nitrogen to avoid issues of contamination, and products formed will be evaluated through traditional means (GC/MS/NMR).

\subsubsection{Electrochemical Characterization of Redox Processes}
All synthesized catalyst will be evaluated for their redox behaviour using a rotating ring disk electrode (RRDE) system. A thin film of the particles will be dispersed on a graphite electrode which is rotated at various speeds in an electrolyte. Through baising (electrochemical) the ring electrode while the disk is not biased the redox behaviour of the various intermediates formed during the photocataytic tests can be discerned. Specific nitrogen based gases and compounds can  (e.g. nitrate, nitrite, NO, N$_2$, NH$_3$) will be dissolved or saturated in the electrolyte and the redox peak will be discerned in a controlled environment. Correlating the observed peaks with the control peaks can provide insight into what dominate reactions are occurring on the various minerals as a function of their size, shape, structure. 


%Furthermore, DFT-based computational studies have provided initial insight into the thermodynamics of nitrogen fixation on rutile (110) and iron-doped rutile (110) surfaces. The free energy pathway for dissociative (i.e. direct N-N bond scission) and associative (i.e. N$_2$ hydrogenation before dissociation) mechanisms on pristine rutile (110), an oxygen O-br vacancy on rutile (110), and an Fe-substitution on rutile (110) are illustrated in Fig. \ref{fig:DFT_fixation_energies}. The results indicate that Fe surface sites do not significantly improve the energetics, while the presence of O-br vacancies significantly improves the binding of NH$_x$ species. However, the low stability of N* and HNNH* result in thermodynamic barriers of $>$ 1.5 eV that are not surmountable at room temperature. Thus, the question of how the N-N bond is dissociated on TiO$_2$ remains an open question. In the same work\cite{Comer_2017}, we show that oxidative N-N bond scission is more favorable, and that the pathway for photo-nitrification on TiO$_2$ is thermodynamically feasible under illumination. This suggests that a complex interplay of photocatalytic reductive and oxidative processes governs the interaction between TiO$_2$ and nitrogen species. However, significant work remains to understand the role of other rutile facets and surface defects, and the energetics of nitrogen fixation and nitrification on both anatase and hematite.

\subsubsection{Impact of Temperature}
\vspace{2mm}

%In-situ electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) and Ultra-violet/Visible (UV/Vis) spectroscopy will be utilized to discern the photoactivity and trapping sites on the catalyst during photocatalysis. X-band EPR is exceptional at directly probing the electron trapping dynamics through controlled low temperature (helium cooled) experiments in the presence of hole scavengers. Through integration of EPR spectra, paramagnetic spin concentration can be determined during experiments. Interstitial concentrations of Ti3+ and Ti4+ can be estimated (g\~1.9), and hole trapping sites at the surface have been previously observed (g=2.014). Through variable temperature testing (10 K to 300 K), transient charge separation and recombination can also be monitored. Total electron concentration during EPR testing will be obtained with UV/Vis. Gaining insight into the total electron concentration can aid in providing quantitative information regarding the percentage of electrons which are become trapped during their transport to the conduction band. These results will aid in providing detailed molecular level information regarding carrier transport and during the photoexcited process, which will inform DFT calculations. 

%Transfer of holes from the valance band can occur if an electron donor adsorbs to the electrode surface. More commonly this is referred to as electron transfer from an adsorbate to the photo-generated hole in the valence band. Understanding the dynamics of these “hole transfer” processes has primarily been completed through the use of thiocyanate (SCN-) as a hole scavenger. Extensive experiments on TiO$_2$ have shown the electron transfer process from SCN- to the photo-generated hole may take place on the picosecond time scale, which is significantly faster than the rate of electron-hole recombination process. While the hole transfer process on TiO$_2$ is relatively efficient, a range of time scales have been reported for other hole accepting adsorbates (alcohols, diols, carbohydrates), lasting from picoseconds to hundreds of nanoseconds. This points to the adsorbate limiting the rate at which a photo-generated hole can be transferred, rather than the TiO$_2$. Hole scavengers (SCN-) will be used during the ultra-fast spectroscopy testing to evaluate if photoreduction of nitrogen to ammonia is possible with and without catalyst and dopants.

Thrust III will leverage the materials synthesis (Thrust I) and testing (Thrust II) in order to provide \emph{fundamental insight into the nature of interactions between mineral surfaces and nitrogen species} under environmentally-relevant photocatalytic conditions. This thrust will make use of advanced in- and ex-situ spectroscopic techniques, including XPS, EXAFS, and EPS, in order to probe the interaction between mineral surfaces and adsorbed species. This will be coupled with DFT calculations of free energy pathways to unravel the complex phenomena that enable photocatalyic nitrogen transformations at the surfaces of titania and hematite materials.

%Performing in situ surface science based experimentation allows us to begin to better understand the photofixation pathways. Typically, however, surface science measurements such as XPS require ultra high vacuum environments, which are not environmentally relevant. To begin to evaluate environmentally relevant conditions Hatzell has led efforts to perform in-situ experimentation at Lawrence Berkeley's Advanced Light Source. This facility has the unique capabilities of having near ambient pressure XPS (AP-XPS). We were the first researchers to begin to evaluate nitrogen photofixation using this technique when we traveled there in August 2017. Our preliminary trip allowed us to begin to evaluate single crystal titania, which was used as a model system to evaluate through theory. Single crystals are non-ideal substrates for photocatalysis as they have few defects, and therefore nitrogen activation is difficult. Future testing to be completed in December of 2017, will move toward evaluating amorphous semiconducting materials which will be discussed in detail below.

%Despite these challenges, our initial AP-XPS results have already provided unprecedented insight into nitrogen fixation at a rutile (110) surface, as well as opened new questions and hypotheses regarding the nature of the active site. In the initial experiments photofixation of nitrogen to a reduced form was detectable (Fig. \ref{fig:experiment3}c). This was observed through the change in the N1s spectra. No oxidized nitrogen species were detected in either the N1s or O1s peaks. Interestingly, the N1s peak which was responsive to light (corresponding to reduced nitrogen), was only responsive when trace amounts of amorphous carbon was on the titania. If this impurity was oxidized from the surface, the shifted N1s peak disappeared (Fig. \ref{fig:experiment3}b-f). These advanced surface science provides evidences that not only defects play a role, but environmental impurities (like carbon) also may be critical for photofixation. We intend to further investigate these impurities in Thrust III. 

%These results are complemented by DFT calculations of the free energy pathway of both nitrogen fixation (Fig. \ref{fig:DFT_fixation_energies} as well as reverse nitrification on the rutile (110) surface (Fig. \ref{fig:FEDs}a-b); however, these free energy diagrams suggest that formation of reduced nitrogen species is limited by thermodynamic barriers, although we note that reverse nitrification is thermodynamically feasible under photocatalytic conditions (Fig. \ref{fig:FEDs}b). This raises the question of how the N-N bond is dissociated on the rutile surface. While the question remains open, the insight regarding surface carbon species suggests a particularly promising hypothesis that surface carbon participates in photocatalytic nitrogen fixation. The energetics of a carbon substituted for a bridging oxygen (C-br) defect for nitrogen fixation is shown in Fig. \ref{fig:FEDs}(c). This reveals a remarkably strong N$_2$ binding energy of -2.4 eV, compared to an endergonic adsorption of 0.2 eV for N$_2$ on other rutile sites (Fig. \ref{fig:DFT_fixation_energies}). Although the subsequent hydrogenation to N$_2$H is highly exergonic, this computational finding supports the hypothesis that carbon may play a key role in the process. The goal of this thrust is to discern the nature of the active site and rate-liming step for various nitrogen transformations at titania and hematite surfaces.

\subsection*{Risk Assessment \& Contingency Plan}
\label{sec:risks}
\vspace{2mm}

One potential risk is the possibility that the rate-limiting reaction occurs via a direct photo-excitation of an adsorbed complex. This will complicate experimental investigations, and  necessitate the use of an excited-state theoretical method that goes beyond DFT. Given the preliminary results, and modern understanding of the similar water-splitting process \cite{Hellman_2017}, we anticipate that this situation is unlikely; however, in the case that it occurs we will employ a two-pronged contingency plan. First, the proposed thermodynamic theoretical approach will still be useful in identifying the relevant initial state of the photo-excited rate-limiting reaction, and EPR experiments will aid in identifying charge transfer dynamics. Second, the GW approximation will by applied to the initial/final state complexes in order to assess the unoccupied states and excitation dynamics. This will provide insight into experimental investigations to probe specific photon absorption bands near the excitation frequency of the initial state. %<- not sure how good/bad of a "contingency plan" this is... it might just confuse them. Feel free to modify/remove. The main thing is probably to point out that we will use GW if excited state information is needed. Of course we should probably have some other experimental risks and alternate plans as well.

Hatzell will lead all photochemistry thrusts, Medford will lead all computational efforts, and Hatzell and Tang will divide the materials synthesis and characterization efforts. There will be close communication between the computational and experimental efforts, with bi-monthly meetings scheduled to aid in guiding both efforts in tandem.

\section{Broader Impacts}
\label{sec:BI}
\vspace{2mm}

\subsection{Broader Impacts to Society}
\vspace{2mm}

Managing the nitrogen cycle has been deemed a critical component of the food-energy-water (FEW) nexus, as control over the composition of reduced and oxidized nitrogen species in soils is needed for adequate food production. Furthermore, with growing populations in a range of centralized and decentralized regions, understanding nutrient transformations processes will only grow in importance. The critical first step in managing the nitrogen cycle, will only come if the magnitude and mechanisms of each N-based transformation is defined. This is historically difficult, as the  nitrogen cycle is known to be the most complex biogeochemical nutrient cycle.  The proposed broader impact of this work will specifically aim to determine how solar-driven abiotic N-transformations contribute to nutrient cycles. The resulting fundamental insights will enable prediction of how environmental factors affect nitrogen transformation rates, providing key inputs into advanced quantitative models of the nitrogen cycle. Furthermore, the insight from this work has implications for the development of new technologies distributed fertilizer production via fixing nitrogen at ambient conditions, as well as potential new routes to mitigate nitrate pollution in groundwater.

\subsection{Education and Outreach}
\vspace{2mm}

\subsubsection*{Advance discovery and understanding while promoting teaching, training, and learning:} Georgia Tech is currently launching a 10 year program aimed at better incorporating the ideas surrounding social sustainability into the curriculum and student body. This program is called ‘Serve-Learn-Sustain’ (SLS). Hatzell and Tang served as a Food-Energy-Water (FEW) fellows within the program, and Medford is currently an Energy Fellow. The aim of this program is to bring together faculty, to discuss ways to incorporate the ideas from their research (Abiotic Nitrogen Cycle), into their courses. The PIs are each currently applying various relevant aspects of this project into their courses (thermodynamics, numerical methods, geochemistry). 

In addition, through an internal competition, Hatzell and Medford raised funds to support a food-energy-water related capstone project for Georgia Tech Seniors. Specifically, the PI's are designing a capstone 2018 semester which will have the students focus their efforts on building a small scale dinitrogen photofixation reactor and analyze the fertilization capacity of the resulting effluent. The capstone will be multi-disciplinary, and will have aspects related to technological development as well as social sustainability to align with the goals of the Serve-Learn-Sustain program. All PIs are also specifically working with the SLS program to \underline{\textbf{assess}} students connection to FEW related topics. A survey will be collected in each class at the beginning and the end of the semester to assess how students' views evolved on FEW related topics.
\vspace{2mm}

\subsubsection*{\textbf{Enhancing Infrastructure for Research and Education}}
\vspace{2mm}

The PIs aim to enhance the infrastructure of ambient pressure XPS for photocatalysis by collaborating with staff scientists at national labs to build research and education networks for the participating students. Specifically the PI's aim to work with Ethan Crumlin at Lawrence Berkeley National lab (LBNL), to perform in situ surface science measurements using AP-XPS. The infrastructure developed to apply AP-XPS to measure nitrogen species at mineral surfaces will also have relevance for numerous other systems in the emerging field of photo(electro)chemical nitrogen chemistry.

\vspace{2mm}

\subsubsection*{\textbf{Broadening dissemination to enhance scientific and technological understanding}}
\vspace{2mm}

Due to the fact that this is a relatively new field of study with tangible implications the PI's will maintain a publicly accessible website detailing our findings and contribute to relevant Wikipedia articles\cite{wiki_photogeochemistry}. Graduate students working on the project will create YouTube videos which describe experimental and theoretical approaches taken during the research program. The fact that the proposed research deals with ambient conditions and common materials leads to a low barrier for interested citizens to conduct simple experiments that are reported in the videos. Disseminating the findings in an open access fashion will aid in accelerating the rate of other researcher's work and engaging public interest. 
\vspace{2mm}

\subsubsection*{\textbf{Broadening the participation of underrepresented groups}}
\vspace{2mm}

The PIs have a history of recruiting underrepresented and minority students. All PIs will apply for REU support to not only support graduate students but undergraduates on this project, with a particular emphasis on recruiting underrepresented minorities. Medford supports the Summer Undergraduate Research Exchange (SURE) and Exxon Mobil ChBE Steps programs at Georgia Tech that allow underrepresented minority students to work on research projects during the summer. The Steps program is specifically targeted to universities with a large number of underrepresented minority students and attempts pave the way for them to obtain a dual degree from their original university and Georgia Tech.
